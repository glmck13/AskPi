# Askpi
A lightweight personal assitant for your Linux/Raspberry Pi host
## Background
For some time I've wanted to convert my Raspberry Pi into a personal assitant, like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, etc.  I dabbled with [Amazon's Alexa Skill Kit (ASK)](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit), and [Facebook's WIT[(https://wit.ai/), but was frustrated since I had to develop and host my app in their cloud.  Moreover, I wasn't looking to develop a very sophisticated voice command systms, just something that could respond to some very basic utterances.
